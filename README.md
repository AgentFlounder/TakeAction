# Take Action

What can we do to get more people to protest? (And resist?)

I find that having concrete steps I can take to volunteer makes it more likely I will take action and doing so, I feel empowered and energized instead of overwhelmed. I'm not powerless or alone and neither are you.

This excellent guide is well worth taking the time to read: [INDIVISIBLE: A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO DEMOCRACY ON THE BRINK](https://indivisible.org/resource/guide)

## Grow our numbers

Step 1. Talk to a friend, keep each other informed. 

Step 2. When they get to a point where they want to do something about what's going on or they feel powerless, give them all this info.

Step 3. Ask them to follow these instructions.

Step 4. Go to step 1

Geometric growth folks. If 5 people tell 5 people who each tell 5 people and so on you get a hundred thousand pretty fast.

That said not everyone is going to jump at the chance to join us. Stay strong and try to hold onto optimism. Or DM me if you need a boost. :) 

The people who know what's at stake will *jump* at the chance to do something. That was the case for two of my friends so far.

We need progressives, people who refuse to be bought to run for office. We can change American politics but it is a long game of 30-50 years. 

But it needs to happen right now. And it starts with someone like you running. Run for school board, City council, local, state, federal offices. whatever. Here’s a guide on how.
