# Take Action

What can we do to get more people to protest? (And resist?)

I find that having concrete steps I can take to volunteer makes it more likely I will take action and doing so, I feel empowered and energized instead of overwhelmed. I'm not powerless or alone and neither are you.

This excellent strategy guide for regular people like you and me is well worth the 20-30 minutes to read it: [INDIVISIBLE: A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO DEMOCRACY ON THE BRINK](https://indivisible.org/resource/guide)

This is a simple list of things you can do: [What Can You Do Now?](https://whatyoucandonow.org/)

## Grow our numbers

Step 1. Talk to a friend, keep each other informed. 

Step 2. When they get to a point where they want to do something about what's going on or they feel powerless, give them all this info.

Step 3. Ask them to follow these instructions.

Step 4. Go to step 1

Geometric growth folks. If 5 people tell 5 people who each tell 5 people and so on you get a hundred thousand pretty fast.

That said not everyone is going to jump at the chance to join us. Stay strong and hold onto your optimism. The people that know what's at stake will be eager to help.

## Contact your elected officials

Phone calls are still the [most effective means](https://5calls.org/why-calling-works/) of contacting your representatives. Provide your name and address and staffers will tally your call or voicemail right away.

Contact your representatives using:

* https://5calls.org (phone) -  provides scripts if you're not sure what to say. 
* https://resist.bot (email, fax, letter) you type your message via SMS, Messenger, Insta, etc.

Contact the White House. White House Comments line – (202) 456-1111 White House Switchboard – (202) 456-1414

Try to meet folks IRL if you can, to make connections & expand support for each other. You can search for local groups protesting or supporting your top issues.

Look up your local chapter of Indivisible and other resistance organizations. https://indivisible.org/

Each state usually also has an equality org like Equality California and One Colorado.

Be an ally. Wear LGBTQ ally gear IF IT’S SAFE TO. Be safe, first and foremost. Buy from LGBTQ artists and businesses, especially books that are being banned. ESPECIALLY trans. 


## Immigration

It is important for immigrants and citizens to know their rights regarding immigration. ICE has been shown to abuse their power.

Order these Red Cards from a print shop and leave at places in the community like on bulletin boards, at willing businesses, etc. to inform people of their rights. https://www.ilrc.org/red-cards-tarjetas-rojas

We need progressives, people who refuse to be bought to run for office. I believe we can change the face of American politics but it is a long game of 30-50 years.

But it needs to start right now. And it starts with someone like you, fellow Redditor, running. Run for school board, City council, local, state, federal offices. whatever. Here’s a guide on how.

## Read and learn

Unplugging from doom scrolling is a good idea and expanding your mind with books is always good.

Here are some books I have read, or have been recommended to me:

* On Tyranny, Timothy Snyder. Quick read with 20 lessons to fight tyranny from the 20th century. I can't recommend this enough.

* [Ur-Fascism, Umberto Eco](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/umberto-eco-ur-fascism) - actually more of an essay including the 14 characteristics of Fascism.

* [The Ten Stages of Genocide](https://www.genocidewatch.com/tenstages)

Often Recommended but I haven't read them yet.

* It Can't Happen Here, Sinclair Lewis. I see this recommended very often.

Recommended by some but no clue if they're worth it or not. Please don't yell at me if they suck :)

* Origins of Totalitarianism, Hannah Arendt. Cited often by Snyder but that's all I know.

* Anatomy of Fascism, Robert Paxton

* Fascism: A Quick Immersion, Roger Griffin

* Fascism: Roger Griffin

* Why Civil Resistance Works, Erica Chenoweth

* Civil Resistance, What Everyone Needs To Know, Erica Chenoweth 

* More recommendations here: https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/s/OCpkBJj5mp

## Notes

I am attempting to keep this maintained and usually end up editing it dozens of times a week to add new info, delete old, improve writing.

Please share far and wide.

Input, ideas, and feedback welcome.
